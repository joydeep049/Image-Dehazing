## Image Dehazing Using Redisual Blocks and Surface Smoothness Regularization Loss

In this project, I present an improved method for single-image dehazing utilizing Residual Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). My approach integrates a decaying learning rate strategy and introduces a novel regularization loss, which I term Surface Regularization Loss. Traditional dehazing techniques often suffer from residual artifacts and fail to generalize well across diverse haze conditions. To address these limitations, I propose a Residual GAN architecture that leverages the Surface Regularization Loss, which works by taking higher-order derivatives of the plane surface to effectively reduce artifacts and enhance image smoothness. The decaying learning rate further ensures stable and efficient convergence of the model, allowing it to adapt dynamically during the training process. Extensive experiments conducted on the RESIDE benchmark dataset demonstrate that my method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and visual quality. The proposed model exhibits superior generalization capabilities, providing clear and artifact-free dehazed images under various challenging conditions. These advancements highlight the potential of my Residual GAN framework as a robust solution for single-image dehazing.
